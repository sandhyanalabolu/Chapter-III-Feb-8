        <h1>An Overview Of<br>
Value Chains, Supply<br>
Chains And Strategic<br>
Alliances Issues</h1><br>
  <h2>Introduction</h2> <hr>     
</center>
        <p>In the competitive scenario unfolding at the beginning of the 21st century,
characterized by the fast pace of technologic changes and opening and
volatilization of global markets, an understanding of global value chains is of
critical importance to outlining strategy.</p>
        <p>As shown in Chapter II, in the most complex production chains, assessing
bargaining power in relation to customers and suppliers may not be enough to
understand the power relationships in the global competitive market. Imagine
a semiconductors industry, whose clients may be the PC industry, but also be
in telecommunications, electronics end users, and new areas such as smart
cards. How can one discuss bargaining power based only on the elements
introduced on Chapter II?</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the process of decentralizing production activities, very
often marked by globally-based outsourcing and by the streamlining of
yesterday’s large corporate structures, created the so-called “network-com</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>panies.” According to Chesnais (1996), large companies operating on a global
basis gave priority to some functions considered strategic, leading a global
chain of suppliers and distributors, performing activities previously performed
by verticalized companies.</p>
        <p>This process of “de-verticalization” presents some risks. However, when a
company takes over value activities, it is possible to enforce its interests over
other chain links by using its economic power.</p>
        <p>For small companies, which are part of these large chains, the understanding of
power dynamics and relations is decisive for their survival and development,
and to outline defensive strategies enabling them to increase their relative power
in the chain by means of partnerships and networks of cooperation.</p>
        <p>The issues discussed are vital for strategy definition, since they bring a more
detailed understanding of the game rules of the global value chains and of how
to take advantage of its configuration, using networks and partnerships, or
making use of location.</p>
        <p>This chapter intends to present a more in-depth discussion of the supply chain,
introducing issues such as location, networks of cooperation, and the study of
governance, both of local and global scope. The concept of value chains, both
in product-based and in service-based industries, are addressed.</p>
        <h1>How to Define the Term Chains</h1><hr>
        <p>You are certainly familiar with the concepts of value chain, supply chain and
global value chains. Are these expressions synonymous or is there a difference
in concept among them?</p>
        <p>The first source of confusion is the fact that different research areas study the
same phenomenon: the connection of several linkages in a chain, deployed in
several tiers, from input to selling in global markets. These academic approaches
are from the areas of strategy, logistics and operations, in addition to
the economists, geographers, and social scientists.</p>
        <p>Although there are several similarities between these approaches, each area
emphasizes different features of this phenomenon, as presented in the following
sections.</p><br><hr><br>
        <h2>The Value Chain</h2><hr>
        <p>For Porter and Millar (1985, p. 3), the value chain “is system of interdependent
activities, which are connected by linkages,” and could be divided in technologically
and economically distinct activities that a company uses to do
business, which affect cost or efficiency of other activities. Each of these
activities would be a value activity.</p>
        <p>Nine generic activities have been identified by these authors, and classified in
two groups: support activities and primary activities, as shown in Figure 3.1.
The four support activities are: firm infrastructure, human resources management,
technology development, and procurement. The five primary activities
are: inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and
services. To be performed, each one of these activities requires a physical and
a data processing component, which is the reason why information technology
(IT) has such a large impact on the value chain, as shown on Chapter VII.</p>
        <p>The value system concept is an enlargement of the value chain concept,
contemplating an industry’s value chains from suppliers to end-consumers.
Figure 3.2 shows the connections between activities within this value system.</p>
        <p><i>Figure 3.1. The value chain (adapted from Porter & Millar, 1985)</i></p>
        <img src="image.html.jpg">
        <p><i>Figure 3.2. The value system (adapted from Porter & Millar, 1985)</i></p>
    <img class="img1" src="image1.html.jpg"><br><hr><br>
        <p>It should be stressed that the value chain concept coined by Porter and Millar
(1985) is contained within the firm bonders, and that the value system concept
is the one bearing more similarity to the themes discussed in the next section,
that is, supply chains and global value chains.</p>
        <p>Duhan et al. (2001), however, argue that in knowledge-based companies there
are difficulties in using value-chain analysis, as shown in Table 3.1. In this kind
of company, the value chain is less evident, due to the process’s interactive
nature, making it difficult to discriminate the added value of a single step. On
the other hand, in knowledge-based companies, human resources are essential
in achieving competitive advantage, which requires competence to extract
individual knowledge from experts through collaboration, managing a relevant
amount of informality.</p>
        <p>Quinn et al. (1990) also emphasize the knowledge assets in companies,
especially in so-called intelligent enterprises, such as biotechnology, semiconductor
and electronics industry. In these industries, these authors identify a
loosely structured network around specialized core competencies, with a
service-based strategy.</p>
        <p><i>Table 3.1. Value chain analysis applied to knowledge-based companies</i></p>
        <img class="img2" src="image2.html.jpg" style="width: 600px;">
        <p><i>Figure 3.3. The service-profit chain (adapted from Schlesinger & Heskett,
1991)</i></p>
        <img class="img3" src="image3.html.jpg" style="width: 600px;"><br><hr><br>
        <p>Schlesinger and Heskett (1991) also argue that human resources are a critical
resource in service activities and propose a service-profit chain, as shown in
Figure 3.3. These authors argue that if the company just has employee
satisfaction and retention it could be possible to achieve customer satisfaction
and retention and, in consequence, a competitive advantage. A similar idea was
proposed by Rucci et al. (1994) that highlights employee importance in the
service value chain, so-called employee-customer profit chain.</p>
        <p>Heskett et al. (1994) also propose a service-profit chain audit, which allows
making a diagnosis through 25 questions classified in the following categories:
profit and growth, customer satisfaction, external service value, employee
productivity, employee satisfaction, employee loyalty, internal
service quality, leadership, and relating the measures.</p>
        <h2>Supply Chain</h2><hr>
        <p>Several researchers, especially in the logistics area, use the expression supply
chain. According to Bowersox and Closs (2001), supply-chain management is
the integration of the company’s essential business processes, from raw
materials to end-users.</p>
        <p>Although this definition bears some similarity to the value system, in this case
there is no concern with differentiating between support and primary activities,
emphasizing the same primary activities, i.e., logistics.</p>
        <p>With the increase of outsourcing, logistic alliances took on a more relevant role
in the formulation of corporate strategies. According to Bowersox (1990), the
concept of logistic alliances characterized by cooperation, often based on
informal agreements, forms a business pact where each part seeks the benefits
of synergy brought on by joint work. Logistic partnerships are distinguished
from other business cooperation models by the very strong connection between
the participants, who, in practice, create an extended organization with its own
role, rules, values, and goals.</p>
        <p>The most common forms of logistic alliance involve a<i> producer and a service
            supplier</i>, such as storage or transport company, and it can also combine
service suppliers’ resources.</p>
        <p>Other common forms of logistic alliance are<i> vertical alignment between two
            or more producers, and horizontal alignment</i>. The former is usually marked
by inventory transfer and the latter sells to the same customer base. Both may
include a service provider.</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>For researchers in the operations-management area, the emphasis is on supplychain
management, originating from the study of customer-suppliers cooperation
networks typical of Japanese companies, know as keiretsu, which display
very distinctive collaboration and partnership patterns. An example of these
networks is the one headed by Japanese assemblers that guides suppliers, not
only of the first tier, but also of the other tiers, transferring technology so as to
avoid loss and lack of efficiency, so that the added value can be transferred to
consumers. In this context, the concept is very similar to the value system
concept presented in the section above.</p>
        <p>The main issues referring to supply-chain management, in this scope, have
been discussed in Chapter II.</p>
        <h2>Global Value Chains</h2><hr>
        <p>Finally, according to Gereffi (1994), the expression global value chains, found
throughout the literature in several areas, can be characterized by the production
and marketing of goods involving strategic decisions and the forming of
international networks.</p>
        <p>For Gereffi (1994), there are two basic shapes of global value chains:
            <i>producer-driven chains and buyer-driven chains</i>.</p>
        <p>In <i>producer-driven chains</i>, the key assets are productive, enabling large
manufacturers to coordinate inter-organizational networks, making intensive
use of capital and technology, such as those of the automobile and airplane
industries.</p>
        <p>As for<i>buyer-driven chains</i>, the key assets are commercial, such as brand
names, or marketing channels. The coordinators of the chain are the large
retailers, designers and trading networks, which control how, when, and where
the production will take place and what profit share should be attained at each
step of the chain, though they have no productive devices. These chains usually
involve third-world suppliers, such as shoes and toys (Gereffi, 1999). The main
differences between these chains are summarized in Table 3.2.</p>
        <p>In more recent papers, Gereffi (2001) introduces a new chain configuration
called the internet-oriented chain, i.e., production chains driven by the Internet.
This configuration is detailed in Chapter X.</p>
        <p>Although the production chain description bears similarities to the previous
definitions, here there is more stress on four dimensions, namely:</p><br><hr><br>
        <p><i>Table 3.2. Governance structures in global value chains (adapted from
Gereffi, 2001, p.34)</i></p>
        <img class="img4" src="image4.html.jpg" style="width: 600px;">
        <p>1. A value chain of goods, services and resources in one or more industrial
sector. In this context, it should be stressed that the meaning of value
chain in Gereffi (2001) is different from the nomenclature proposed by
Porter and Millar (1985), in which global value chain means value
system.</p>
        <p>2. Geographic dispersion of chains on the regional, national, and global
levels.</p>
        <p>3. Governance structure along the global value chain (value system), “which
refers to the key-actors in the chain that determine the inter-firm division
of labor, and shape the capacities of participants to upgrade their
activities.” (Gereffi, 2001, p. 30)</p>
        <p>4. Institutional framework.</p>
        <p>Other authors, such as Storper and Harrison, (1991) use the <i>production
            system </i>concept, which has some similarities to the value system concept, and
is defined as the coordination structure of the chain, with vertical and horizontal
relations among companies, that can be governed by market mechanisms or
relations between the links.</p>
        <p>These authors emphasize, as a relevant dimension, besides the governance
structure and productions system features, the existence of clusters of compa-</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>nies. Storper and Harrison, (1991) stress the importance of local issues,
            especially cluster environment, in the competitive environmental analysis.</p>
<p>Thus, in order to have a better understanding of the competitive environment,
the issues of location and clusters of companies are essential to make a good
map of the competitive environment and will be detailed below.</p>
        <h1>Location: The Role of Clusters<br>
in Competitiveness</h1><hr>
        <p>Studies of clusters or local production systems, among other names, originated
from several areas, such as economic geography, regional development,
competitive strategy studies, and technology development and innovation.</p>
        <p>A cluster can be defined as a geographic or sector concentration of companies,
originating from external economies (externalities) and joint collaborative
actions, enabling collective efficiency gains and entrance to global markets,
which individual companies would not attain.</p>
        <p>Incidental external economies involve qualified labor, specialized suppliers of
goods and services, and the overflow of knowledge and technology.</p>
        <p>Joint actions, achieved by deliberate and conscious effort, can be divided into
two kinds: cooperation between companies (e.g., sharing equipment) and
groups of companies organized into associations or consortia, as for exportation.
These joint cooperation actions can be horizontal (among competitors) or
vertical (among chain tiers).</p>
        <p>Thus, the emphasis lies not only on the incidental aspects resulting from
externalities and historical aspects, but also on those related to forming a
network relationship between companies and other institutions important for
competition, capable of generating joint actions.</p>
        <p>The forming of clusters has an impact on productivity and scale, on innovation
and new business. In this sense, companies entering a cluster and getting
benefits from concentration and specialization have a competitive advantage.
These benefits usually enable the locality to compete in the global market by
entering production chains.</p>
        <p>Being in a cluster enables a company easy access to qualified manpower,
minimizing expenses for training, and appropriating knowledge and technology
by the overflow effect. Information and knowledge transmission flow either by</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>a formal or informal learning process. Highlighted, however, is the role of
cooperative joint actions which allow risk reduction, increase of increase and
resources sharing, as stated above.</p>
        <p>The negative points could be blocking effects and asymmetries. Blocking
effects, due to the excess of external economies, tend to dissuade the
concentration of companies, generating, for instance, high transport and rental
costs, canceling out part of the mentioned advantages. Asymmetries appear
when the leading companies have a strong influence over the strategy of other
cluster companies and inhibit joint cooperation actions.</p>
        <p>In summary, three aspects contribute to the analysis of local concentration:
<i>competitive market, cluster collaborative environment, and cluster collective
    competencies</i> as shown in Figure 3.4.</p>
        <p>The kind of governance structure in the chain where the cluster seen is inserted,
has a strong influence on the possibilities for industrial upgrading and the kind
            of local or global markets reached, i.e., in <i>competitive market</i>.</p>
        <p>The kind of local governance seeks to identity the existence of a leading
company that conditions the strategy of the other companies in the cluster and
            the potential for joint action, i.e., affect<i> cluster collaborative environment</i>.</p>
        <p>Finally, the <i>cluster collective competencies </i>also has an impact on the
competitiveness of the cluster, investigating the degree of rootedness of
technology knowledge, and discussing the stages of technology maturity.</p>
        <p>Collective competence can be seen as the ability to attain competitive advantages,
shared by companies included in geographically concentrated complexes,
or clusters, that an isolated company could not have.</p>

        <h2>Cluster or Industrial Districts: A Summary of the
Theoretical Discussion</h2><hr>
        <p>Geographic proximity appears as an inductor of externalities (such as qualified
labor and access to raw materials) by agglomeration from the time of the first
industrial districts formed at the end of the 19th century, generating increasing
earnings, as suggested by Krugman (1995).</p>
        <p>Heizer and Render (1999) show high concentrations of a specialized labor
workforce such as those for cartooning in the Philippines and the perfume
industry in France as factors attracting global industries in these sectors to these
areas, generating competitive advantages.</p>
        <p>The literature reveals several approaches to the treatment of this theme. In this
project, the main conceptual focus is on issues related to the strategic impact
and to governance, as well as location factors and innovation inducers.</p>
        <p>One of the major exponents of the strategic approach to clusters is the
researcher Michael Porter, especially the papers of Porter (1998) and Porter
and Stern (2001), where the author/s discusses the strategic impact of clusters
on corporate competition and on countries.</p>
        <p>Porter (1998) dissects the anatomy of some of the main clusters in search of the
main players and their relationship concerning competition and cooperation.
According to the author, it is possible to identify a network of relations between
companies and other agencies related to competition, geographically concentrated
and acting in a given field. This network includes suppliers specialized in
raw materials, equipment and services, as well as adequate infrastructure and
access to distribution channels and consumers. And finally, there are, in several
clusters, government agencies and other institutions such as universities,
technical training services, standards association, commercial associations,
and trade unions.</p>
        <p>In summary, Porter’s study (1998) presents clusters as a competitive advantage
for regions, resulting from the harmony between competition and cooperation,
enabling the use of local competencies. Three aspects related with the
forming of clusters are stressed by the author in leveraging competitiveness: the
impact on productivity and scale, on innovation, and in forming new business.
These impacts generated by the forming of clusters are capable of changing the
composition of the five forces of competition in relation to the structural analysis
of the industry (Porter, 1979).</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>The existing literature on the impact of industrial clusters on regional development
is extensive, encompassing the industrial districts in Italy and in other
countries and its impact on economic growth, which is mostly attributed to the
effectiveness of small and midsized enterprises (SME) networks, as well as to
local level cooperation achieved in the industrial districts of that country and to
their inclusion in global chains (Scott & Storper, 1988; Porter, 1998; Porter &
Stern, 2001; Ghemawat, 2001).</p>
        <p>Schmitz (1992) reports on a flexible specialization, based on a division and
organization of production where SMC divided the different production phases
of a single product among themselves. The creation of this form would be based
on the following features: (a) geographic concentration of companies acting in
the same industrial sector; (b) presence of companies of different sizes but with
more participation of SMC; (c) production specialization between different
companies on the vertical division level, involving producers and suppliers of
all kinds of products and services and technological support; (d) large quantity
and flexible variety; (e) different companies share horizontal-level production,
by outsourcing and complementarities; (f) the most successful complexes
compete on other dimensions besides price; (g) ease of entry for new
companies; (h) access to information and service networks (Ruas et al., 1994).</p>
        <p>Courlet (1993) argues that the industrial location of a small company is done
following a different rationale from the large corporations, and proposed the
study of their location according to the local industrial systems. These
systems can be seen as companies concentrated around one or several
industrial sectors, interacting among them and with the socio-cultural environment,
generating productive externalities for all the companies. Thus, these
systems’ focus is not exclusively economics, but also historic, cultural, and
social.</p>
        <p>This author stresses, as location factors, the totality of technical capabilities and
the preexisting industrial sectors, the population’s cultural identity and habits,
quality of life, education, low crime rates, and good elementary and technical
schools, that complete the framework for attracting investments and growth for
these systems.</p>
        <p>The large corporation is usually present in technology transfer, in managerial
assistance, in training businesspeople and workers and especially in coordinating
the production and distribution system, which encompasses a park of small
companies. This kind of configuration, with a large corporation organizing a
network of smaller companies, can be found in areas of the Silicon Valley in</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>California and along route 128 in Massachusetts. A similar situation can also be
found in the industrial organization of the Emilia Romagna area, in Italy.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, a large corporation or a lead company can bring a strong
asymmetry to local companies, as shown by Belussi (1999) in his analysis of the
Italian industrial districts. This author found that asymmetric relations between
the companies located on the Italian districts have been increasing, forming
strongly hierarchic governance structures headed by the large corporations.</p>
        <p>However, it is noteworthy that the trends towards specialization and innovation
depend on the kind of goods produced and the dynamics of the market where
the companies are installed. Under conditions where cost-based competition
strategies predominate, these features are not found, characterizing what
Segenberger and Pyke (1990) called low-road strategies.</p>
        <h2>Governance Analysis: Global and Local</h2><hr>
    <p>The concept of governance was discussed by Williamson (1985), and later
developed by Hollingsworth and Lindberg (1986), Jessop (1998), Humphrey
and Schmitz (2000), and others, to address the process of coordinating the
economic players at the public and private, local, and global levels.</p>
        <p>Fleury and Fleury (2000) stress that the main idea of production-chain analysis
is the identification of power structures or governance, where one or more
corporations coordinate and control geographically separate economic activities.</p>
    <p>Humphrey and Schmitz (2000, 2001) compiled literature on governance and
distinguished four kinds of governance: arm’s-length market relationships,
networks, quasi-hierarchy, and hierarchy. For these authors, there are intermediate
governance structures, where both market-relations as well as hierarchies
yield to horizontal structures between the involved parties, resulting in more
frequent interactions, with a higher degree of collaboration and cooperation
among the companies. It should be stressed, however, that intermediate
structures do not necessarily mean an absence of asymmetries.</p>
        <p>The relevance of considering different kinds of governance is in the fact that the
differences in the coordination patterns of the players has direct influence on
their ability of upgrading possibilities of the actors along the chain, and could
also have a bearing on their response to fast changes in today’s context.
Governance structures characterized by strong hierarchies, evolving from the</p><br><hr><br>

    <p>unequal bargaining power held by the companies involved in the process,
represent the greatest threats to the power connections.</p>
        <p>For the corporation, identifying the kind of governance held by the chain’s
players enables it to avoid such threats, by planning neutralizing strategies,
turning the tables, and creating opportunities by means of alliances, partnerships,
and networks.</p>
        <p>Another relevant component in this analysis is local governance, which has an
important role in coordinating joint actions among a cluster’s companies. This
local-level governance does not necessarily replicate the global value chain
relations, since very often this locality represents only one link in a large global
chain. Schmitz (1997) distinguishs between horizontal cooperation and vertical
cooperation, as well as bilateral and multilateral, as shown in Table 3.3.</p>
        <p>The main players in this kind of governance are local development agencies and
trade associations, who catalyze joint actions of local enterprises, promoting local
development and the dynamism of this group of companies. On the other hand, the
lead firm’s role in conditioning the cluster’s dynamics is also an important issue to
be stressed, since the other companies also benefit from the leader’s development,
even if unbalanced.</p>
        <p>There are also forms of public local governance that can be coordinated by
local government, through the establishment and maintenance of institutions
which support local companies, such as training centers, technology services
suppliers, and governmental development agencies, among others. According
to Porter (1998), clusters enable a new kind of dialogue between the private
and public sectors. Government, in its various spheres, should provide educated
citizens and high-quality infrastructure. But in this context, there is an
important government role: the legislature, both in terms of the rules of
competition (laws protecting intellectual property, antitrust, etc.), and to the
definition of an industrial policy, which fosters the creation, and growth of
clusters (tax reductions, etc.). It is important to stress the role of funding by
agencies and banks.</p><br><hr><br>
        <h1>Decision-Making Tool Applied to<br>
Environment Analysis</h1><hr>
        <p>Besides the environment analysis presented in this chapter, there are several
decision-making tools that could help the strategist to make a good map.</p>
        <p>The Rivalry Matrix, proposed by Furrer and Thomas (2000), is a focusing tool
for several analysis models of the competitive environment. Its function is to
shown the analyst which is the best model to use in a given market situation. It
presupposes that each of the existing models is only effective when applied in
a more specific situation, and that the combined use of four models can
encompass most of the possible situations.</p>
        <p>The Rivalry Matrix includes the two following dimensions, which are used to
classify the market under study and to recommend which model should be used:
            <i>the number of decision variables and the nature of the environment</i>
(Figure 3.5).</p>
        <p>According to Furrer and Thomas (2000), the number of decision variables
is related to the complexity of the problem under analysis. In more focused
cases, such as the launching of a new product, all external variables are taken
as constants, while in more complex cases, when the company must decide
between several alternatives, the number of variables increases. A typical
example of a case with several variables, presented by the authors, is when a</p>
        <p><i>Figure 3.5. Rivalry matrix (adapted from Furrer & Thomas, 2000)</i></p>
        <img class="img6" src="image6.html.jpg" style="height: 400px;width: 500px;"><br><hr><br>
        <p>company tries to fight a competitor’s price reduction, and has several different
strategies, such as to reduce price, launch a new product, improve its own
product, enter a new market, or any combination of these alternatives. The
authors state that as the problem becomes more complex, and the number of
variables increases, the more difficult it becomes to model the situation and the
player’s competitive movements.</p>
        <p>Another dimension used in the Rivalry matrix is the <i>nature of the environment.</i>
In order to be able to tell which environment is foreseeable or not, it is important
to study the market and its evolution. In predictable environments, market
variations are very small, or show a constant and organic evolution. On the
other hand, turbulent and unpredictable markets are historically characterized
by creation of new substitute technologies or by the entrance of a new
competitor coming from a totally different industry, causing unbalance and
leading to sudden changes in the player’s movements (Furred & Thomas,
2000).</p>
        <p>The combination of the two dimensions— the<i> number of decision variables
            and nature of the environment</i> —comprise the four quadrants of the Rivalry
matrix (see Figure 3.5). The analyst must classify the market under study on one
of the two quadrants, selecting the best model for his study.</p>
        <p>The models analyzed and classified by Furrer and Thomas (2000) according
to the main authors in the rivalry matrix are the following:</p>
        <p><b>• Game Theory Modeling </b>(e.g., Camerer, 1991; Oster,1999)</p>
        <p><b>• Scenarios, Simulations, and System Dynamic Modeling </b>(e.g., Porter
& Spence, 1982; Mezias & Eisner,1997)</p>
        <p><b>• Warfare and multipoint competition </b>(e.g., Karnani & Wernerfet,
1985; Chen,1996; DÁveni, 1994)</p>
        <p><b>• Frameworks </b>(e.g., Porter, 1980, 1991)</p>
    <p>The frameworks were presented in Chapters II and III, and the others models
will be discussed in the second part of this book</p><br><hr><br>
        <h1>Case Study: Strategy and<br>
Decisions in Perspective</h1><hr>
        <h2>Case – Fashion Design Networks</h2><hr>
        <p>Of all the links of this chain, the clothing sector has great importance in the
foreign market, since it represented 45.4% of the total in 2000. It should thus
be stressed that the clothing industry responds for almost half of total exports
resulting from other links in the chain.</p>
        <p>Management of trademarks, development of fashion design and product
concept, quality, and marketing became more and more important as critical
factors for the success of the brazilian textile industry. Companies adopting the
fashion vanguard as a competitive strategy try to distinguish their products,
responding rapidly to market signals and fostering creativity, innovation and
supply-chain management.</p>
        <p>Each season, new collections with new fabrics, patterns, colors, and models
are introduced, affecting the whole textile and clothing supply chain. The
shorter the development cycle for new products, the greater the need to
intensify the relations along the supply chain, so as to make the sector aware
of the consumers’ needs.</p>
        <p>Thus, there is a need to be more flexible. However, it should also be stressed
that vanguard companies require that these chain linkages be willing to form
long-term partnerships, providing exclusive patterns and finishing in small lots
for each season, and trust and confidentiality are essential. These are mid to
large-sized companies that maintain a quite balanced and close relationship
with the hub company, involving joint development of new products (codesign).</p>
        <p>Although patterns of competition present great variation according to the sector
and consumer profile, it can be observed that the fashion vanguard companies
have been strengthening their own brands or licensing foreign brands trying to
obtain overseas markets. At the same time, these companies articulate a wide
outsourced network of companies and retail stores, supported by information
technology, with effective control of quality and delivery time. These companies,
considered vanguard, are responsible for the quick introduction of
product innovation in the brazilian market, in tune with the main fashion centers.
The hub companies give priority to product design, brand name, and marketing,
and the rest of the production process is done according to an outsourcing</p><br><hr><br>
        <p>system typical of this sector. In this system, there is a service supplier without
its own product line, working only under order for third parties. This service
supplier makes available facilities, equipments, and workforce, while the hub
firm provides all inputs and manufacture procedures. This kind of operation is
very common in the cut-and-sew phase that can be done by different service
suppliers. These suppliers are usually small, with close but standardized
relationships, with a high degree of asymmetry in their relationships with hub
firm and low bargaining power. The information system is basically done via the
Internet, since these companies have a low degree of information technology.</p>
        <p>The selling is done by brand stores, with intensive use of franchising systems.
The brand is really a relevant issue for companies working with strategies. It
must give to the chosen market segment a strong identification, the feeling of
belonging to a given lifestyle (street, club, surfwear, etc.). Retailers play an
important role, since both architecture and decoration must impart the same
concept. Along with these factors, there is also the availability of a full line of
products, including products and accessories, promotional items, distinctive
packages, and media-covered events. Just as in the case of the service
suppliers, the franchise-holding companies receive the complete detailed
retailer project and are interconnected by an EDI information system. Franchisers
have frequent relations with the hub company, but it seems more like a
partnership, since they are important channels that should be kept close to the</p>

        <p>target-market, working as a sensor of market needs and as disseminators of the
            hub companies’ concept.</p>
<p>The activities developed by the hub firm can be divided as follows: marketing
and promotion, brand store projects, development of the collection, and
suppliers. Figure 3.6 shows the relationship between companies articulated by
a vanguard hub company. The width of the arrows represents the intensity of
interactions among the networks companies and the shape of the arrow — full
or striped — represents the nature of the relationship, standardized and
asymmetric relationship, or balanced partnership.</p>

        <p>5. Which are the elements of a structure of innovation capacity?</p>
<p>6. Considering the case in the section titled Fashion Design Networks,
answer the following questions:</p>
        <p>• Discuss this corporate network according to the various chain
            approaches presented.</p>
<p>• Which is the role of the vanguard company in this context? How does
it affect the outsourced companies’ strategy?</p>
